/*Create a dice rolling game. The game should allow a user to toss
up to six dice at a time. Each toss of a die will be stored in a sixelement integer array. The array will be created in
the main()
function, but passed to a new function called TossDie(). The
TossDie() function will take care of generating random numbers
from one to six and assigning them to the appropriate array
element number.*/
